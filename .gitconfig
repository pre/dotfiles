# Find out which branch contains a change
#   $ git branch --contains 50f3754
#
##
# See which changes from a branch are already present upstream:
#
#   # while on "feature" branch:
#   $ git cherry -v master
#
#    + 497034f2 Listener.new now accepts a hash of options
#    - 2d0333ff cache the absolute images path for growl messages
#    + e4406858 rename Listener#run to #start
##
# Show the last commit which message matches a regex
#   $ git show :/fix
#   # shows the last commit which has the word "fix" in its message
#
#   $ git show :/^Merge
#   # shows the last merge commit

    # Pull & Rebase
    #
    # Because branch merges in git are recorded with a merge commit, they are
    # supposed to be meaningful—for example, to indicate when a feature has
    # been merged to a release branch. However, during a regular daily workflow
    # where several team members sync a single branch often, the timeline gets
    # polluted with unnecessary micro-merges on regular git pull.  Rebasing
    # ensures that the commits are always re-applied so that the history stays
    # linear.
    #
    # You can configure certain branches to always do this without the --rebase flag:
    # % git config branch.master.rebase true
    rull = pull --rebase

    # If you want to execute a git pull or use git merge in order to explicitly
    # fast-forward, and you want to bail out if it can't fast-forward, then you
    # can use the --ff-only flag. This way you can regularly do something like
    # git pull --ff-only without thinking, and then if it errors out you can go
    # back and decide if you want to merge or rebase.
